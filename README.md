# Cisco MPP IP Phone Screen Visualizer

With these HTML templates, you can continously fetch the content of a Cisco IP Phone's display and present it on your laptop inside a realistic high-res phone frame.

This is an excellent tool for demos, or technical meetings where the audience is interested in seeing what happens inside a phone.
